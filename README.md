A Practical Study and Comparison of Integer Factorization Methods
======
A project by [Alex Gustafsson](https://github.com/AlexGustafsson) and [Marcus Lenander](https://github.com/MarcusLenander) in the course MA1453 (Cryptography 2) at BTH, Sweden.

This project evaluates the relative performance of various algorithms for integer factorization, namely Trial Division, Fermat's Factorization, Pollard's Rho Algorithm, Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Factorization Algorithm and briefly the Quadratic Sieve. The algorithms are presented and described with regards to use and implementation details. No effort was made to optimize the implemented algorithms further than what is considered logical. No algorithm leverages parallel computing techniques, dynamic programming techniques or other techniques in order to gain performance. No consideration of performance was made when the software and programming stack were chosen.

The paper was written on a public instance of [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com) - The easy to use, online, collaborative LaTeX editor, and built on a private instance of the same service. ShareLatex makes it easy to collaboratively write a paper using LaTeX whilst still being completely free and partly open source.

The code is available in the default branch [cocalc](https://github.com/AlexGustafsson/practical-factorization-comparison/).
