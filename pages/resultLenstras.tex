The result of Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Factorization Algorithm factorizing a set of small primes can be seen in \ref{numbersuites}. The first plot, \ref{fig:LenstrasEllipticCurveFactorizationsmallprimes(maximumIterations:1)factors} shows the outcome of stopping Lenstra's algorithm after one iteration. The second plot, \ref{fig:LenstrasEllipticCurveFactorizationsmallprimes(maximumIterations:-1)factors} shows the algorithm stopping after $\sqrt{n}$ iterations.

The result of Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Factorization algorithm factorizing a set of large primes as seen in \ref{numbersuites}. The first plot, \ref{fig:LenstrasEllipticCurveFactorizationlargeprimes(maximumIterations:1)factors} shows the outcome of stopping Lenstra's algorithm after one iteration. The second plot, \ref{fig:LenstrasEllipticCurveFactorizationlargeprimes(maximumIterations:-1)factors} shows Lenstra's algorithm after beings topped at $\sqrt{n}$ iterations.
