\chapter{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank Robert Nyqvist of BTH for mentoring us during the two months we worked on the algorithm implementations used in this paper. Robert Nyqvist provided us with general information about topics related to the paper, numeric examples of algorithms, feedback on data gathering methods and more. For his help we are ever grateful.
