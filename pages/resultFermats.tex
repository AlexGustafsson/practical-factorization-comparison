The result of Fermat's Farctorization method factorizing a set of growing primes as seen in \ref{numbersuites}.

\input{FermatsPlots/FermatsGrowing.tex}

The factorization went well until it starts to factorize a whole number consisting of two 35 bits long prime numbers. From this point it starts to take a large amount of time to factorize. After the whole number, consisting of two 42 bits long prime numbers, the algorithm was stopped because the factorization did not finish within eight hours. 
More Fermat's plots can be found in the appendix.
